# hello-world
Just another repository

Hello, There!

I am new to Git. I first started coding back in 1999 after taking an intro to the internet course along with other CIS classes at Pulaski Technical College. I have been a web developer and designer for more than a decade. I enjoy Front End Development!

Although I am not new to web development, I enjoy continuous learning and like to hone skills by taking classes, watching tuturiols, reading books, etc. as well as by working on some projects with other programmers. 

Anyway, I'm just doing the hello world tutoriol after signing up for the freeCodeCamp to familarize myself with GitHub.
